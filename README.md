# AI & Machine Learning Repository

This repository documents my coursework and practical experiments in Artificial Intelligence. It tracks my progression from fundamental problem-solving techniques to modern machine learning applications.

## 📌 Overview
The goal of this repository is to explore the spectrum of AI, starting with classical search strategies and moving toward statistical learning and predictive modeling.

## 📂 Key Focus Areas

### 1. Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)
*Applying statistical methods to discover patterns in data.*

* **Classification:** Implemented Decision Tree models using ID3/CART algorithms. The work includes data preprocessing (Label Encoding), comparing splitting criteria (Entropy vs. Gini Impurity), and using regularization parameters to prevent overfitting.
* **Regression:** Developed Linear Regression models to predict continuous variables. This includes comparing Simple (univariate) vs. Multiple (multivariate) regression and evaluating accuracy using Mean Squared Error and $R^2$ scores.

### 2. Classical AI (Search Algorithms)
*Solving problems through state-space search and optimization.*

* **Heuristic Search:** Implementation of the A* (A-Star) algorithm using heuristics to find optimal paths in graph traversals.
* **Adversarial Search:** Application of Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize Minimax decision-making trees in game theory scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
    * `pandas` & `numpy` (Data Manipulation)
    * `scikit-learn` (Model Training & Evaluation)
    * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` (Data Visualization)
